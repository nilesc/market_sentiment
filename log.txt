Extracting twitter spikes:
My first approach is as follows:
    1) Extract the number of tweets per day at each company
    2) Convert this into a series
    3) Extract peaks as described by ranco
    4) Join this with market data for the corresponding days
    5) Apply a linear regression
Found nothing significant

Next, try modifying the approach to better match Ranco.
